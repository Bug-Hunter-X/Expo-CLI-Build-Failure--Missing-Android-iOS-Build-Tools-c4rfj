# Expo CLI Build Failure: Missing Build Tools

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Expo projects: failure to locate the necessary Android or iOS build tools.  The `expoBug.js` file shows a sample project (though the project code itself isn't the source of the error).  The solution involves ensuring that the correct SDKs and command-line tools are installed and properly configured for your operating system.

## Setup:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Follow the instructions in `expoBugSolution.js` to resolve the build error.

This issue often manifests as a cryptic error message from the Expo CLI.  The resolution requires proper environment setup specific to your development environment.
