This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project. It happens when you try to run the project on an emulator or physical device and the Expo CLI cannot find or access the necessary Android or iOS build tools.  The specific error message might vary depending on your operating system and the build tools you have (or don't have) installed.  For example you might see a message indicating a missing Java SDK, Android SDK, or Xcode command-line tools.
