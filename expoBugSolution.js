The solution to this problem involves verifying and installing the necessary build tools.  The specific steps depend on your operating system:

**For Android:**

1. **Install the Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure you have a compatible JDK installed.  You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. **Install the Android SDK:** Download the Android SDK command-line tools from the [Android developer website](https://developer.android.com/studio).  Make sure the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is set correctly to point to your SDK directory, and that the platform-tools and build-tools directories are added to your `PATH` environment variable.
3. **Verify Android SDK Installation:** Run `android` in your terminal to open the Android SDK Manager. You might need to install specific Android platform build tools and components based on your app's requirements.

**For iOS:**

1. **Install Xcode:**  Download and install Xcode from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). 
2. **Install command-line tools:** Open Xcode, go to `Xcode > Preferences > Locations`, and ensure the command-line tools are installed. You may also need to run `xcode-select --install` in your terminal.

**After Completing Setup:**

1. **Restart your terminal or IDE.**
2. **Try running `expo start` again.**

If the issue persists, double-check your environment variables and ensure that all necessary paths are correctly set.
